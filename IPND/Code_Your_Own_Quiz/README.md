# Code Your Own Quiz

> In this Project, I have a created quiz program using python code. 

Both files gives you the same result , you can download either one of the file and execute in command prompr=t using `pyhton <filename.py>`

You need `Python 2` version to run this code, becuase these codes will not work in `Python 3`.
